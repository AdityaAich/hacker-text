# hacker-text
A simple Javascript plugin that animates text to look like it's decoding.

To use simply include the hacker-text.js in a script tag on your website, and add the class '.hacker-text' so any body of text such as &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;spans&gt; etc.
  
To change the speed of the decoding add one of the following classes:
  hacker-text-slow
  hacker-text-medium
  hacker-text-fast
  
There are currently three decoding styles.

default (No Class):
  Where random characters are decoded in any order.
  
type (add '.hacker-text-type' class):
  Where the text is decoded in order with a | character at the end, as if it's typing.
  
stars (add '.hacker-text-stars' class):
  Where the text is converted to astericks and then decoded in order.
